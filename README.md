## How To Run Source Code

First you have to download whole project source code.Then create a Database. 

Open Source Code.Go to Database Folder , open 'bdtechzo_new_bdtechzone.sql' from any texteditor. Next open read-me.txt and copy the text. Then 'replace all' this  text from bdtechzo_new_bdtechzone.sql to 'path where you keep your source code'. 

Example:  http://localhost/wptestsite ===> replace all ===> http://rh-rumman/wordpress/bd-techzone

Now go to phpmyadmin & select your database. Import this sql file.

Put your code to your exact location.

Open "wp-config.php". Change DB_NAME,DB_USER & DB_PASSWORD as you set.

Admin Panel : Username => 'rumman' & Password => 'fLtTFG!FOYM8@iOtopJBSeO8'

Now,Go to Database Folder. Open 'core.options.txt' file & copy the text. 

Now , Go to Dashboard->Appearance->Theme Options. Then Click the 'import' options in the right corner,paste the text & Apply the code.                  

#### That's All.Thanks.
